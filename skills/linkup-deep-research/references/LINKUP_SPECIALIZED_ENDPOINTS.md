# Linkup Specialized Endpoints Guide

Use this document to decide when to use the `/research` and `/extract` endpoints instead of the synchronous `/search` API.

For individual query construction on the standard Search API, use `LINKUP_AGENT_QUERY_MENTAL_MODEL.md` and `LINKUP_PROMPT_OPTIMIZER_KNOWLEDGE.md`. For workflow orchestration, use `LINKUP_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`.

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Your Need | Endpoint | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Quick lookup (< 10s), simple facts | `/search` with `fast` or `standard` | Low latency, synchronous |
| Discover URL → scrape content | `/search` with `deep` | Handles chaining in one request |
| Complex report requiring 5+ minutes of investigation | `/research` | Multi-source, iterative, thorough |
| Bulk extract structured rows from a known page | `/extract` | Purpose-built for extraction |
| Verified answer to a precise question requiring cross-checking | `/research` mode=`answer` | Built-in verification |
| Focused investigation of a defined entity | `/research` mode=`investigate` | Systematic subject analysis |
| Broad market analysis across many entities | `/research` mode=`research` | Parallel multi-subject coverage |

## Research Endpoint (`/v1/research`)

The Research endpoint is an **autonomous research agent** that runs asynchronously for minutes, not seconds. It investigates the web iteratively, gathering evidence from multiple sources in parallel, cross-checking claims, and producing a synthesized, cited answer.

### When to Choose Research over Deep Search

| Factor | Deep Search (`/search` with `depth=deep`) | Research (`/v1/research`) |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Latency** | Seconds (typically 5-30s) | Minutes (2-20 min depending on depth) |
| **Investigation style** | Single planning turn, executes plan | Iterative, multi-turn investigation |
| **Source coverage** | Limited by single-request context | Extensive parallel source gathering |
| **Cross-checking** | Limited | Built-in verification across sources |
| **Synthesis** | Basic concatenation | Structured synthesis with reasoning |
| **Cost model** | Per-request | Per-call with depth-based pricing ($0.25-$2.50) |
| **Best for** | "Find X, then scrape it" chains | "Investigate this thoroughly" questions |

### Research Modes

Choose the mode that matches your question type:

| Mode | Use When | Example Query | Behavior |
|------|----------|---------------|----------|
| `answer` | Precise question with a single correct answer, requires verification | "Which 12 S&P 500 companies gained >50% with market cap >$5B in Q3 2025?" | Agent self-verifies, cross-references evidence, reasons against alternative candidates |
| `investigate` | In-depth analysis of a defined subject | "Risk profile and regulatory history of Stripe" | Follows discovered threads, explores new trails, verifies claims along the way |
| `research` | Broad, multi-angle exploration | "State of the European generative AI market in 2026" | Searches multiple threads in parallel, covers topics/entities broadly |

**Rule of thumb:** If the question ends with "?" and expects a single answer → `answer`. If it asks about "the state of" or "analysis of" → `research`. If it focuses on one entity comprehensively → `investigate`.

**Important:** Always set `mode` explicitly for predictable latency, cost, and output shape. Omitting it lets the agent auto-classify, which is convenient but less predictable.

### Reasoning Depths

| Depth | Time | Cost | Use When |
|-------|------|------|----------|
| `S` | 2-5 min | $0.25 | Light coverage, short multi-step investigations |
| `M` | 3-7 min | $0.50 | Balanced cost/quality, routine use |
| `L` | 5-10 min | $1.50 | Thorough investigation (default) |
| `XL` | 10-20 min | $2.50 | Exhaustive coverage, deliverables where completeness trumps speed |

### Prompt Detail Levels

Research runs as an agentic loop: the agent interprets the question, plans retrieval, executes parallel searches, verifies claims, and synthesizes. Both terse and detailed inputs work — more precise input produces more thorough, predictable, aligned output.

**Dimensions to specify for best results:**

| Dimension | What to Include |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Angles to cover | Specific aspects of the topic to investigate |
| Leads to pursue | Known starting points, companies, people, documents |
| Facts to verify | Claims that need cross-referencing |
| Entities to compare | Side-by-side comparison targets |
| Constraints | Exclusions, scope boundaries, required sources |
| Output structure | Format, sections, length expectations |

**Example progression:**

```text
# Terse — agent chooses angles and detail level
What's going on in the European AI inference market?

# Medium — angle and deliverable constrained
Survey the European AI inference market in 2026: identify the main hyperscalers 
and independent inference providers, their pricing posture, and regulatory pressure 
under the EU AI Act.

# Fully specified — all dimensions defined
Produce a competitive landscape of European AI inference providers operating in 2026.

Scope:
- Cover at minimum: Mistral, Aleph Alpha, Silo AI, OVHcloud, Scaleway
- Exclude US-headquartered hyperscalers unless they operate EU sovereign offerings

For each provider, surface:
- Headquarters and primary inference regions
- Models served and deployment modes
- Disclosed pricing normalized per million tokens
- Sovereignty and EU AI Act posture
- Latest disclosed funding

Verify all numeric claims against primary sources. Flag figures only found in secondary aggregators.
```

### Common Research Patterns

#### Pattern A: Verified Fact-Finding

**Scenario:** User asks a precise question requiring cross-checking multiple authoritative sources.

```
POST /v1/research
{
  "q": "What was Amazon's total advertising revenue in Q4 2024, and how did it compare to Q4 2023?",
  "mode": "answer",
  "reasoningDepth": "M",
  "outputType": "sourcedAnswer"
}
```

**Why Research wins:** The agent will find Amazon's official earnings, cross-check against analyst reports, and resolve any discrepancies with reasoning.

#### Pattern B: Risk & Compliance Report

**Scenario:** Generate a comprehensive risk profile that requires examining multiple angles (financial, legal, operational).

```
POST /v1/research
{
  "q": "Comprehensive risk assessment for vendor {company_name}: financial stability, security incidents, regulatory actions, leadership changes, and customer complaints from 2022-2026",
  "mode": "investigate",
  "reasoningDepth": "L",
  "outputType": "structured",
  "structuredOutputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "financialRisks": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
      "securityIncidents": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object"}},
      "regulatoryActions": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object"}},
      "overallRiskRating": {"type": "string", "enum": ["low", "medium", "high", "critical"]}
    }
  }
}
```

**Why Research wins:** Multi-angle investigation with cross-referencing between financial news, security databases, and regulatory filings.

#### Pattern C: Market Landscape Analysis

**Scenario:** Understand a market space with multiple players, trends, and dynamics.

```
POST /v1/research
{
  "q": "European generative AI market 2026: key players, funding rounds, enterprise adoption rates, regulatory impact, and competitive dynamics",
  "mode": "research",
  "reasoningDepth": "XL",
  "outputType": "sourcedAnswer"
}
```

**Why Research wins:** Breadth across many entities requires parallel investigation that would exceed deep search's single-request context.

#### Pattern D: Due Diligence Dossier

**Scenario:** Pre-meeting or pre-investment deep dive on one company.

```
POST /v1/research
{
  "q": "Complete company profile for {target_company}: business model, revenue estimates, competitive positioning, leadership background, recent strategic moves, and customer sentiment",
  "mode": "investigate",
  "reasoningDepth": "L",
  "outputType": "structured",
  "structuredOutputSchema": { ... }
}
```

**Why Research wins:** Comprehensive, structured output on a single subject with thorough source coverage.

### Research Anti-Patterns

Don't use Research when:

- **Latency matters** → Use `/search` with `fast` or `standard`
- **Simple lookup** → "What is Stripe's CEO name?" is overkill for Research
- **Real-time chat** → Research's 2+ minute latency breaks conversational flow
- **Known URL extraction** → Use `/extract` or `/fetch` for structured data from a specific page
- **Already have sources** → If you have the URLs, use `/fetch` or `/search` with direct scraping

### Implementation Notes

**Async Lifecycle:**

```
POST /v1/research → immediate response with {id, status: "pending"}
  ↓
Poll GET /v1/research/:id with backoff
  ↓
When status is "completed", output contains answer + sources
  ↓
When status is "failed", check error field for details (no charge for failures)
```

**Polling strategy (exponential backoff):**

```python
interval = 2  # Start at 2 seconds
max_interval = 10  # Cap at 10 seconds

while True:
    result = client.research.get(task_id)
    if result.status in ("completed", "failed"):
        break
    time.sleep(interval)
    interval = min(interval * 2, max_interval)  # Double until cap
```

**Expected completion times:**
- S depth: 2-5 minutes
- M depth: 3-7 minutes
- L depth: 5-10 minutes
- XL depth: 10-20 minutes

**Rate limiting:** Above 1 request/second will be rate-limited. Use backoff, not fixed-interval rapid polling.

**Long-running tasks:** For production workloads, submit via Tasks endpoint and check periodically rather than maintaining blocking polling loops.

## Extract Endpoint (`/v1/extract`)

The Extract endpoint is a **structured data extraction agent** that transforms web pages into tables of records. Given a seed URL and a natural-language description of what rows you want, it extracts matching records and returns them as an NDJSON file.

### When to Use Extract

| Scenario | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Directory/List pages** | Extract all team members from /team page |
| **Product catalogs** | Extract all products with price, SKU, description from a catalog |
| **Job listings** | Extract all open roles with title, location, department from /careers |
| **Conference speakers** | Extract all speakers with name, company, topic from event page |
| **Paginated lists** | Extract all items across multiple pages of results |
| **Verification workflows** | Extract + verify URLs are reachable |

### When NOT to Use Extract

| Instead Use | For |
|-------------|-----|
| `/search` | Finding information across the web (not extracting from one known page) |
| `/fetch` | Reading a single article or document |
| `/research` | Synthesizing information from multiple sources |

### Extract vs. Search Scraping

| | Extract | Search with scraping |
|--|-----------|----------------------|
| **Starting point** | You provide the exact URL | Search discovers URLs |
| **Output format** | NDJSON file with structured rows | Inline response with content |
| **Scale** | Designed for 10s-1000s of records | Designed for 1-10 pages |
| **Pagination** | Handles automatically | Must specify or handle manually |
| **Schema enforcement** | Optional strict schema | Inferred from query |
| **Best for** | Bulk extraction from known listing pages | Research and discovery workflows |

### Common Extract Patterns

#### Pattern A: Team Directory Extraction

**Scenario:** Enrich company data with full team information.

```
POST /v1/extract
{
  "q": "All leadership team members with name, job title, bio summary, and LinkedIn profile URL",
  "url": "https://example.com/about/leadership",
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "name": {"type": "string"},
      "title": {"type": "string"},
      "bio": {"type": "string"},
      "linkedinUrl": {"type": "string", "format": "uri"}
    },
    "required": ["name", "title"]
  },
  "verifyUrls": true
}
```

**Result:** Download NDJSON file with one row per executive, LinkedIn URLs verified reachable.

#### Pattern B: Product Catalog Extraction

**Scenario:** Competitive pricing analysis from competitor's product page.

```
POST /v1/extract
{
  "q": "All pricing plans with plan name, monthly price, annual price, key features included, and any usage limits",
  "url": "https://competitor.com/pricing",
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "planName": {"type": "string"},
      "monthlyPrice": {"type": "string"},
      "annualPrice": {"type": "string"},
      "features": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
      "limits": {"type": "object"}
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:** Structured pricing comparison data for analysis.

#### Pattern C: Job Listing Monitoring

**Scenario:** Track competitor hiring patterns.

```
POST /v1/extract
{
  "q": "All open positions with job title, department, location, posting date, and required skills",
  "url": "https://competitor.com/careers",
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "title": {"type": "string"},
      "department": {"type": "string"},
      "location": {"type": "string"},
      "postedDate": {"type": "string"},
      "skills": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
    }
  }
}
```

**Result:** Weekly extract to track hiring velocity by department.

### Extract Parameters

| Parameter | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| `schema` | Always provide for production use. Ensures consistent output structure and helps the agent understand required fields. |
| `verifyUrls` | Enable when extracted URLs will be used downstream (prevents broken links). Adds latency. |

### Implementation Notes

**Async Lifecycle:**

```
POST /v1/extract → immediate response with {id, status: "pending"}
  ↓
Poll GET /v1/extract/:id every 30 seconds
  ↓
When status is "completed", output contains resultUrl (24h expiry)
  ↓
GET resultUrl → download NDJSON file
  ↓
Parse: one JSON object per line
```

**Pricing:** Variable based on page size, rows extracted, pagination depth, and verifyUrls. Typical: $2-10 per task. Minimum $10 account balance required.

**Polling guidance:** Poll every 30s (slower than Research due to typically longer crawl times).

## Choosing Your Endpoint: Decision Tree

```
Do you have a specific URL to extract structured records from?
├── YES (team page, product catalog, job listings, directory)
│   └── Use /extract
│       └── Provide schema for consistent output
│
└── NO (discovery needed, or research question)
    └── Is this a simple, quick lookup?
        ├── YES (CEO name, stock price, simple fact)
        │   └── Use /search with depth=fast or depth=standard
        │       └── Synchronous, < 10s response
        │
        └── NO (complex, multi-source investigation)
            └── Does the answer require < 30 seconds?
                ├── YES (chatbot, real-time UI)
                │   └── Use /search with depth=deep
                │       └── Single planning turn, limited by request context
                │
                └── NO (report, analysis, verification can wait minutes)
                    └── Use /research
                        ├── Mode = answer → precise verified facts
                        ├── Mode = investigate → focused entity analysis
                        └── Mode = research → broad multi-subject coverage
```

## Workflow Integration

### Research in Enrichment Workflows

Replace the enrichment workflow's Linkup calls with Research when:

1. **Data quality > speed** — Research's cross-checking produces more reliable firmographics
2. **Conflicting sources common** — Research resolves contradictions with reasoning
3. **Batch/async acceptable** — Can run overnight, not needed in real-time

**Example:** Overnight enrichment batch using Research:

```python
# Queue companies for research enrichment
for company in batch:
    task = client.research.create(
        q=f"Complete company profile for {company['name']}: firmographics, funding, leadership, recent news",
        mode="investigate",
        reasoningDepth="M",
        outputType="structured",
        structuredOutputSchema=ENRICHMENT_SCHEMA
    )
    store_task_id(company['id'], task.id)

# Poll all tasks, store results when complete
```

### Extract in Monitoring Workflows

Combine Extract with Research for comprehensive competitor tracking:

```
Weekly job:
  1. /extract on competitor /careers → hiring patterns (structured)
  2. /research mode=investigate on competitor → strategic moves (synthesized)
  3. /search depth=standard with fromDate=last_week → recent news (quick)
  4. Merge into competitor intelligence report
```

### Hybrid: Search Discovery + Extract

When you don't know the URL but know the data structure you need:

```
Step 1: /search depth=standard
  "Find the careers page URL for {company_name}"
  
Step 2: Extract from discovered URL
  POST /v1/extract with url=<result_from_step_1>
```

---

## Summary Table: All Linkup Endpoints

| Endpoint | Type | Latency | Best For | Output |
|----------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `/search?depth=fast` | Sync | 1-3s | Simple lookups, snippets | Quick answer |
| `/search?depth=standard` | Sync | 3-10s | Parallel facts, known URLs | Sourced answer |
| `/search?depth=deep` | Sync | 5-30s | Discover→scrape chains | Sourced answer |
| `/research` | Async | 2-20 min | Complex investigation, reports | Synthesized report |
| `/extract` | Async | 1-5 min | Bulk structured extraction | NDJSON file |
| `/fetch` | Sync | 2-5s | Read specific URL content | Page content |

**Integration principle:** Use the fastest endpoint that can reliably accomplish the task. Escalate to slower, more thorough endpoints when data quality or synthesis depth matters more than speed.
