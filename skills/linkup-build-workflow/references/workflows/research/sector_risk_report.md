# Sector Risk Report

## What The User Gets

A structured sector watch report tailored to one company or client, including trends, regulation,
risks, and implications for the business.

## When To Use

Use for audit teams, investors, consultants, or operators who need a long-running public-source
analysis, not a simple company profile.

## Inputs To Ask For

- Company name and location.
- Sector, NAF/NACE/SIC code, or activity description.
- Business context from the user.
- Geography and export markets.
- Risk areas, such as regulation, sanctions, demand, competition, supply chain, or labor.

## Linkup Workflow

```yaml
step: research
name: Produce sector risk report
purpose: Investigate market, regulatory, and company-specific risks across credible sources.
linkup.research:
  q: Produce a sector risk report for {company_name}, active in {sector_or_activity_code}, located in {geography}. Use this business context to target the research: {business_context}. Analyze market trends, demand, competitors, regulation, export or sanctions exposure, supply chain, labor, and company-specific implications. Prefer official, regulatory, industry, and credible news sources. Return risks, opportunities, evidence, confidence, and source URLs.

## Output Contract

- `risk_area`
- `finding`
- `company_implication`
- `confidence`
- `source_urls`
- `opportunity`

## Handoffs

Send the report to an audit file, investment memo, risk register, or client briefing.

## Failure Modes

- The business context may be too generic to target the research.
- Regulatory sources vary by country and sector.
- The workflow should label uncertainty and not overstate company-specific impact from sector-level
  evidence.
- Use `/v1/research` because this workflow is a long-form sector investigation.
