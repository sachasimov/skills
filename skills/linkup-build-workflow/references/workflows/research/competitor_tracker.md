# Competitor Tracker

## What The User Gets

A recurring update on competitor activity, grouped by signal type and impact.

## When To Use

Use for competitive intelligence, sales enablement, product marketing, and leadership updates.

## Inputs To Ask For

- Competitor names and domains.
- Signal types.
- Date range.
- Product category.

## Linkup Workflow

Use Search API steps for recurring signal collection. Use the Research API when the user wants a
written impact report across competitors, positioning, product, pricing, and market context.

```yaml
step: 1
name: Search competitor changes
purpose: Find recent public updates.
linkup.search:
  q: Find recent public updates for these competitors: {competitors}. Run separate web searches for: product launches, pricing changes, messaging changes, hiring, partnerships, and funding or news. Return competitor, signal type, date, evidence, and source URLs.
  depth: standard
  outputType: searchResults
  fromDate: "{from_date}"
expected_behavior:
  - Multiple web search calls across signal categories.
uses_previous_step: false
produces:
  - competitor_updates
```

```yaml
step: 2
name: Scrape known competitor pages
purpose: Check official pages for changed positioning.
linkup.search:
  q: Scrape these competitor pages: {competitor_pages}. Extract headline, product claims, pricing language, feature claims, customer proof, and source URLs.
  depth: standard
  outputType: searchResults
expected_behavior:
  - Web scraping calls for known URLs.
uses_previous_step: competitor_updates
produces:
  - official_competitor_pages
```

```yaml
step: 3
name: Summarize impact
purpose: Explain what matters.
linkup.search:
  q: Using competitor updates {competitor_updates} and official page evidence {official_competitor_pages}, summarize what changed, why it matters, recommended response, and source URLs.
  depth: standard
  outputType: sourcedAnswer
expected_behavior:
  - Sourced synthesis for business readers.
uses_previous_step: official_competitor_pages
produces:
  - competitor_tracker_summary
```

```yaml
step: research
name: Produce competitor impact report
purpose: Synthesize competitor activity into a strategic update.
linkup.research:
  q: Research recent activity for these competitors: {competitors}. Compare product launches, pricing or packaging changes, positioning, hiring, partnerships, funding, customer proof, and market implications since {from_date}. Explain what changed, why it matters, recommended response, and source URLs.
  mode: research
  reasoningDepth: M
  outputType: sourcedAnswer
expected_behavior:
  - Long-running multi-source competitor report with impact assessment.
uses_previous_step: false
produces:
  - competitor_impact_report
```

## Output Contract

- `competitor`
- `signal_type`
- `date`
- `evidence`
- `source_url`
- `recommended_response`
- `competitor_impact_report`

## Handoffs

Send updates to Slack, battlecards, sales enablement, or product planning.

## Failure Modes

- Many competitor changes are subtle and require known URLs to monitor.
- Search results may repeat syndicated news.
- The workflow should separate confirmed changes from weak signals.
- Use `/v1/research` when leadership or product marketing needs a written impact report.
