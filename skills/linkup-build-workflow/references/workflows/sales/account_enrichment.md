# Account Enrichment

## What The User Gets

A source-backed profile for one account or a batch of accounts, including what the company does, who
it serves, and why it may fit the user's product.

## When To Use

Use this after the user already has company names or websites.

## Inputs To Ask For

- Company name and website.
- The product being sold.
- Fit criteria.
- Buyer roles.
- Any disqualifiers.

## Linkup Workflow

```yaml
step: 1
name: Scrape the known company website
purpose: Get official company positioning and product context.
linkup.search:
  q: Scrape {company_website}. Extract company description, product categories, target customers, pricing or plan evidence if available, integrations, case studies, and source URL.
  depth: standard
  outputType: searchResults
expected_behavior:
  - Web scrape on the known URL.
uses_previous_step: false
produces:
  - official_company_context
```

```yaml
step: 2
name: Add external context
purpose: Verify the account with sources outside the company website.
linkup.search:
  q: Scrape {company_website}. Also run separate web searches for: {company_name} company profile, {company_name} customers, {company_name} funding or news, and {company_name} careers. Return fit evidence, company size signals, recent activity, and source URLs.
  depth: standard
  outputType: searchResults
expected_behavior:
  - One web scrape plus multiple web search calls in one standard batch.
uses_previous_step: official_company_context
produces:
  - external_company_context
```

```yaml
step: 3
name: Score fit
purpose: Summarize whether the account is worth pursuing.
linkup.search:
  q: Using this evidence about {company_name}: {official_company_context} and {external_company_context}, decide whether it matches this ICP: {ideal_customer_profile}. Return fit score, reasons to pursue, risks, missing information, and source URLs.
  depth: standard
  outputType: sourcedAnswer
expected_behavior:
  - Sourced synthesis from collected evidence.
uses_previous_step: external_company_context
produces:
  - account_fit_summary
```

## Output Contract

- `company_name`
- `website`
- `description`
- `target_customers`
- `fit_score`
- `fit_evidence`
- `risks`
- `source_urls`

## Handoffs

Write the account profile and fit score to CRM fields, then pass promising accounts to buyer
discovery or outbound personalization.

## Failure Modes

- The website is stale or too thin; use external searches to compensate.
- The company name is ambiguous; quote the exact company name and include the website.
- The account cannot be scored confidently; mark missing evidence instead of inventing fit.
