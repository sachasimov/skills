- Target audience.
- Geography.

```

```yaml
step: 2
name: Turn signals into angles
purpose: Connect evidence to campaign ideas.
linkup.search:
  q: Using these market signals: {market_signals}, generate campaign angles for {target_audience}. For each angle, include the market truth, why now, suggested message, risk, and source URLs.
  depth: standard
  outputType: sourcedAnswer
expected_behavior:
  - Sourced synthesis from signal evidence.
uses_previous_step: market_signals

  - campaign_angles
```

```yaml
step: 3
name: Package campaign brief
purpose: Make the output usable for marketing execution.

  q: Create a campaign brief from these angles: {campaign_angles}. Return angle name, audience, message, evidence, suggested channels, and source URLs.

## Output Contract

- `angle_name`
- `audience`
- `message`
- `evidence`

- `suggested_channels`

## Handoffs

Send campaign angles to a content calendar, ad planning workflow, or creative brief.

## Failure Modes

- Signals are too generic.
- The user has not specified an audience.
- The workflow should not claim market momentum without public evidence.
