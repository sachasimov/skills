# SEO Source Research

## What The User Gets

A source-backed research pack for an SEO article or landing page.

## When To Use

Use when the user wants to produce content that answers real questions with credible citations.

## Inputs To Ask For

- Topic or keyword.
- Target reader.
- Geography.
- Preferred sources.
- Product or brand angle.

## Linkup Workflow

```yaml
step: 1
name: Find competing and reference pages
purpose: Understand the source landscape.
linkup.search:
  q: Find useful pages for an SEO article about {topic} for {target_reader}. Run separate web searches for: top explanatory pages, credible reference sources, recent reports or statistics, and common questions. Return title, URL, source type, useful angle, and source URLs.
  depth: standard
  outputType: searchResults
expected_behavior:
  - Multiple web search calls for source categories.
uses_previous_step: false
produces:
  - seo_sources
```

```yaml
step: 2
name: Build source-backed outline
purpose: Turn research into a writing plan.
linkup.search:
  q: Using these SEO sources for {topic}: {seo_sources}, create a source-backed outline for {target_reader}. Include sections, questions to answer, evidence to cite, and source URLs.
  depth: standard
  outputType: sourcedAnswer
expected_behavior:
  - User-facing synthesis with citations.
uses_previous_step: seo_sources
produces:
  - seo_outline
```

## Output Contract

- `section`
- `question`
- `claim`
- `source_url`
- `source_type`

## Handoffs

Send the outline to a content writer, SEO platform, or CMS.

## Failure Modes

- Search results may be dominated by low-quality SEO pages.
- The workflow should prefer credible references over content farms.
- If exact source families matter, use `includeDomains` rather than soft preferences.
