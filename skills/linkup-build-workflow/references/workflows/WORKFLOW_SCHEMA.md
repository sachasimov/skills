# Linkup Workflow Schema

Use this schema for every workflow in the Linkup workflow library.

The goal is to make each workflow useful in three places:

- a human-readable website or sales page
- a Git repository of reusable agent ideas
- an agent that turns a business goal into executable Linkup prompt chains

## File Format

Each workflow is a Markdown file with YAML front matter followed by standard sections.

```yaml
---
id: sales.icp_to_lead_list
title: ICP to Lead List
category: sales
summary: Find companies that match a target customer profile and explain why they fit.
user_goal: I want to find companies that look like my best customers.
inputs:
  - ideal customer profile
  - geography
  - company size
  - target industry
outputs:
  - qualified company list
  - evidence for each company
  - recommended next step
linkup_strength: Finds and verifies public web evidence for companies, people, and markets.
handoff_tools:
  - CRM
  - email finder
  - outbound sequencer
---
```

## Required Fields

- `id`: Stable workflow ID in `{category}.{slug}` format.
- `title`: Human-readable workflow name.
- `category`: Main folder/category.
- `summary`: One sentence describing what the workflow does for the user.
- `user_goal`: Plain-English goal this workflow answers.
- `inputs`: Inputs the agent should ask for before running the workflow.
- `outputs`: Final artifacts the workflow should produce.
- `linkup_strength`: Why Linkup is useful for this workflow.
- `handoff_tools`: Tools that should receive Linkup's output when Linkup is not the final system.

## Required Sections

Every workflow body should use these headings:

1. `## What The User Gets`
2. `## When To Use`
3. `## Inputs To Ask For`
4. `## Linkup Workflow`
5. `## Output Contract`
6. `## Handoffs`
7. `## Failure Modes`

## Linkup Step Format

Every step under `## Linkup Workflow` should use either a Search API shape or a Research API shape.

Use `linkup.search` for narrow retrieval, entity lists, enrichment fields, known URL scraping, or
steps that feed another system.

```yaml
step: 1
name: Discover matching companies
purpose: Build the first candidate list.
linkup.search:
  q: Find companies that match {ideal_customer_profile}. Run separate web searches for {facet_1}, {facet_2}, and {facet_3}. Return company name, website, evidence, and source URLs.
  depth: standard
  outputType: searchResults
expected_behavior:
  - Multiple independent web search calls if facets are explicit.
uses_previous_step: false
produces:
  - candidate_companies
```

Use `linkup.research` for long-running investigations, reports, market maps, sector risk, technical
landscapes, event/prediction investigations, and complex dossiers.

```yaml
step: 1
name: Produce market map
purpose: Build a synthesized report across many source families.
linkup.research:
  q: Research the market for {market_definition} in {geography}. Identify segments, visible players, growth signals, customer segments, underserved areas, and source URLs. Cite primary and credible secondary sources.
  mode: research
  reasoningDepth: L
  outputType: sourcedAnswer
expected_behavior:
  - Long-running multi-source investigation with a synthesized report.
uses_previous_step: false
produces:
  - market_map_report
```

Use the atomic rules in `../knowledge/LINKUP_PROMPT_OPTIMIZER_KNOWLEDGE.md` for each `linkup.search` object.
Use `../knowledge/LINKUP_WORKFLOW_OPTIMIZER_KNOWLEDGE.md` for deciding when a step should instead use
`linkup.research`.

## Output Contract

Each workflow should say what downstream software can expect. Prefer stable field names:

- `company_name`
- `website`
- `person_name`
- `role`
- `source_url`
- `evidence`
- `confidence`
- `recommended_next_step`

For `structured` output, always include a shallow JSON schema in the workflow. Do not mark a Search
API or Research API step as `structured` unless the schema is present.

## Quality Bar

A workflow is good when:

- every Linkup call has a clear retrieval job
- steps feed into each other without requiring hidden assumptions
- the workflow says where Linkup stops and another tool should take over
- the final output is useful to a business user, not just technically correct
- failure modes are explicit enough for an agent to recover or ask the user for more input
